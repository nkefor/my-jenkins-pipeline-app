# Building a Complete CI/CD Pipeline with GitOps Actions

This guide provides a comprehensive overview and step-by-step approach for building a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitOps actions. GitOps leverages Git as the single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications, automating deployments and simplifying continuous delivery.

## Introduction to GitOps CI/CD

Traditional CI/CD often involves CI tools directly pushing changes to clusters. GitOps flips this by making Git the central point of truth. Instead of pushing, a GitOps operator (like ArgoCD or Flux CD) *pulls* the desired state from Git and reconciles it with the actual state of the cluster. This approach brings:

*   **Version Control:** Every change is a Git commit, providing a full audit trail and easy rollback.
*   **Consistency:** Ensures the cluster state always matches the Git repository.
*   **Security:** Reduces direct access to the cluster for deployments.
*   **Collaboration:** Leverages familiar Git workflows (Pull Requests) for all changes.

## Core GitOps Principles

*   **Declarative Configuration:** All system configurations (infrastructure, applications) are described declaratively (e.g., Kubernetes YAML, Helm charts, Terraform HCL).
*   **Git as Single Source of Truth (SSOT):** Git is the authoritative source for the desired state of your entire system.
*   **Automated Reconciliation:** A specialized software agent (GitOps operator) continuously observes the desired state in Git and the actual state in the cluster, automatically applying any necessary changes.
*   **Pull Requests for Changes:** All operational changes are initiated via Git Pull Requests, enabling peer review, approval, and an auditable history.

## Key Components and Tools

*   **Version Control System (VCS):** Git (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
    *   **`application-code-repo`:** Stores your application's source code.
    *   **`gitops-config-repo`:** Stores all Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, or Kustomize overlays that define the desired state of your applications and infrastructure in the cluster.
*   **Continuous Integration (CI) Tool:** Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, CircleCI.
    *   Responsible for building application code, running tests, creating Docker images, pushing images to a registry, and **crucially, updating the `gitops-config-repo`**.
*   **Container Registry:** Docker Hub, Google Container Registry (GCR), Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), Quay.io.
    *   Stores your application's Docker images.
*   **GitOps Operator:** ArgoCD or Flux CD.
    *   Installed within your Kubernetes cluster. Continuously monitors the `gitops-config-repo` for changes and automatically synchronizes the cluster's state to match.
*   **Orchestration Platform:** Kubernetes.
    *   The target environment where your applications run.
*   **Templating/Configuration Tools (Optional but Common):**
    *   **Helm:** Package manager for Kubernetes, used to define, install, and upgrade complex applications.
    *   **Kustomize:** A tool for customizing Kubernetes configurations without templating.

## Step-by-Step GitOps CI/CD Workflow

1.  **Application Development & Code Commit:**
    *   A developer writes application code and pushes changes to the `application-code-repo` (e.g., `main` branch).

2.  **CI Pipeline Execution:**
    *   The CI tool (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions) is triggered by the code push to the `application-code-repo`.
    *   **Build & Test:** The CI pipeline builds the application, runs unit and integration tests.
    *   **Build & Push Docker Image:** If tests pass, it builds a new Docker image (e.g., `my-app:1.0.0-build123`) and pushes it to the Container Registry.
    *   **Update GitOps Config Repository:** This is the **critical GitOps step**. The CI pipeline does *not* directly deploy to Kubernetes. Instead, it creates a new commit (or a Pull Request) in the `gitops-config-repo` to update the image tag in the relevant Kubernetes manifest (e.g., `deployment.yaml`). This commit is often performed by a bot or service account with appropriate Git permissions.

3.  **GitOps Repository Update (Pull Request for Infrastructure/Manual Changes):**
    *   For changes to Kubernetes manifests that are *not* triggered by application code (e.g., updating resource limits, adding a new service, changing a ConfigMap, or infrastructure changes), a developer or SRE creates a Pull Request (PR) directly against the `gitops-config-repo`.
    *   This PR undergoes peer review and approval, ensuring all changes are vetted.
    *   Once approved, the PR is merged into the `main` branch of the `gitops-config-repo`.

4.  **GitOps Operator Reconciliation:**
    *   The GitOps operator (ArgoCD or Flux CD), running inside the Kubernetes cluster, continuously monitors the `main` branch of the `gitops-config-repo`.
    *   It detects the new commit (either from the CI pipeline's image tag update or a manually merged PR).
    *   The operator pulls the latest desired state from Git.
    *   It compares this desired state with the current actual state of resources in the Kubernetes cluster.

5.  **Deployment to Kubernetes:**
    *   If there's a divergence between the desired state in Git and the actual state in the cluster, the GitOps operator automatically applies the necessary changes to the Kubernetes API. This "pull-based" deployment ensures the cluster always converges to the state defined in Git.

6.  **Monitoring & Feedback:**
    *   The GitOps operator provides a UI (e.g., ArgoCD UI) to visualize the live state of applications, showing synchronization status, health, and resource details.
    *   Monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) track application and infrastructure performance.
    *   Alerts notify teams of deployment failures or health issues.

## Best Practices for GitOps CI/CD

*   **Separate Repositories:** Keep your application code (`application-code-repo`) separate from your Kubernetes manifests (`gitops-config-repo`). This allows independent evolution and clear separation of concerns.
*   **Declarative Everything:** Ensure all configurations are declarative and version-controlled in Git.
*   **Automate Image Updates:** Use tools or scripts in your CI pipeline to automatically update image tags in your `gitops-config-repo` after a successful build.
*   **Immutable Infrastructure:** Build new Docker images for every change; avoid modifying running containers.
*   **Pull Request Workflow:** Enforce PRs for all changes to the `gitops-config-repo` to ensure review and auditability.
*   **Secrets Management:** Never commit sensitive data directly to Git. Use Kubernetes-native secret management solutions (e.g., Sealed Secrets, External Secrets) that integrate with your GitOps operator.
*   **Environment Management:** Use separate directories, branches, or Kustomize overlays/Helm values files within your `gitops-config-repo` to manage configurations for different environments (dev, staging, prod).
*   **Rollback is a Git Revert:** The easiest way to rollback is to revert the problematic commit in your `gitops-config-repo`. The GitOps operator will automatically reconcile the cluster to the previous state.
*   **Monitor the GitOps Operator:** Ensure your GitOps operator (ArgoCD/Flux) is healthy and actively reconciling.
*   **Observability:** Implement robust logging, metrics, and tracing for your applications and infrastructure to understand their behavior in production.
