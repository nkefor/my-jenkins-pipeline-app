## Introduction to VMware ESXi

ESXi is the foundation of VMware's virtualization platform. It's installed directly on the physical server hardware, providing a virtualization layer that abstracts the hardware resources (CPU, memory, storage, network) and allocates them to VMs.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

*   **VMware ESXi Host:** A physical server with ESXi installed and configured.
*   **Network Connectivity:** The ESXi host must be connected to your data center network.
*   **IP Address:** The ESXi host should have a static IP address configured.
*   **vSphere Client (Deprecated) or vSphere Web Client/HTML5 Client:**
    *   For managing a single ESXi host directly, you can use the **Host Client** (web-based, accessible via `https://<ESXi_Host_IP_Address>`). This is the most common method for direct host management.
    *   For managing multiple ESXi hosts, you'll typically use **vCenter Server** with its vSphere Web Client (Flash-based, deprecated) or vSphere HTML5 Client. This guide will focus on direct Host Client management, but concepts apply to vCenter.
*   **ISO Image:** An ISO file of the operating system you want to install on the VM (e.g., Windows Server, Linux distribution). This should be uploaded to a datastore accessible by the ESXi host.
*   **Datastore:** Configured storage (local disk, SAN, NAS) accessible by the ESXi host where VM files will reside.

## Accessing the ESXi Host Client

1.  Open a web browser.
2.  Navigate to `https://<ESXi_Host_IP_Address>`.
3.  Log in with your ESXi root credentials (or other authorized user).

## Creating a New Virtual Machine

1.  **Navigate to Virtual Machines:** In the ESXi Host Client, click on **"Virtual Machines"** in the left navigator.
2.  **Create/Register VM:** Click on **"Create/Register VM"**.
3.  **Select Creation Type:** Choose **"Create a new virtual machine"** and click **"Next"**.
4.  **Select Name and Guest OS:**
    *   **Name:** Enter a unique name for your VM (e.g., `MyWebServer01`).
    *   **Compatibility:** Leave as default (usually the latest ESXi version).
    *   **Guest OS Family:** Select the appropriate family (e.g., `Linux`, `Windows`).
    *   **Guest OS Version:** Select the specific version (e.g., `Windows Server 2019 (64-bit)`, `Ubuntu Linux (64-bit)`).
    *   Click **"Next"**.
5.  **Select Storage:**
    *   Choose the **Datastore** where the VM's files will be stored. Ensure it has enough free space.
    *   Click **"Next"**.
6.  **Customize Settings:** This is where you configure the VM's hardware.
    *   **CPUs:** Allocate the number of virtual CPUs. Start with 1 or 2 and increase as needed.
    *   **Memory:** Allocate RAM (e.g., `4 GB`).
    *   **Hard disk 1:**
        *   **Size:** Specify the disk size (e.g., `100 GB`).
        *   **Disk Provisioning:**
            *   **Thin Provision:** Allocates only the space currently used by the VM, growing as needed, up to the specified size. (Recommended for most cases, saves storage).
            *   **Thick Provision Lazy Zeroed:** Allocates the full specified size immediately, but zeros out the blocks on first write.
            *   **Thick Provision Eager Zeroed:** Allocates and zeros out the full specified size immediately. (Best performance, but takes longer to create and consumes all space upfront).
    *   **SCSI Controller:** Leave default.
    *   **Network Adapter 1:**
        *   **Adapter:** Leave default (usually VMXNET3 for best performance).
        *   **VM Network:** Select the appropriate virtual switch (vSwitch) or port group that connects to your desired physical network.
    *   **CD/DVD Drive 1:**
        *   **Datastore ISO file:** Select this option.
        *   Click **"Browse..."** and select the ISO image of your operating system from the datastore.
    *   **Video Card:** Leave default.
    *   (Optional) Expand other sections for advanced settings like USB controller, PCI devices, etc.
    *   Click **"Next"**.
7.  **Ready to Complete:** Review your settings. Click **"Finish"**.

## Installing the Guest Operating System

1.  **Power On VM:** In the "Virtual Machines" list, select your newly created VM and click **"Power on"**.
2.  **Launch Console:** Click on **"Console"** -> **"Launch remote console"** or **"Launch web console"**.
3.  **Install OS:** Follow the standard operating system installation prompts within the VM console, just as you would on a physical machine.
4.  **Install VMware Tools:** After the OS is installed, it's crucial to install VMware Tools.
    *   In the VM console window, go to **Actions** -> **Guest OS** -> **Install VMware Tools**.
    *   This will mount a virtual CD-ROM with the VMware Tools installer inside the VM. Follow the installation wizard within the guest OS.
    *   VMware Tools enhance VM performance, enable graceful shutdown, time synchronization, and allow features like copy/paste between host and guest.

## Basic VM Management Tasks

Once the VM is running, you can perform various management operations from the ESXi Host Client:

*   **Power Operations:**
    *   **Power On/Off:** Hard power cycle (like pulling the plug). Use with caution.
    *   **Suspend:** Pauses the VM's state to disk.
    *   **Reset:** Hard reset (like pressing the reset button).
    *   **Shut Down Guest OS:** Gracefully shuts down the OS (requires VMware Tools).
    *   **Restart Guest OS:** Gracefully restarts the OS (requires VMware Tools).
*   **Snapshots:**
    *   **Take Snapshot:** Creates a point-in-time copy of the VM's state and data. Useful before major changes or updates.
    *   **Revert to Snapshot:** Reverts the VM to a previous snapshot state.
    *   **Delete Snapshot:** Removes a snapshot (important for reclaiming disk space and performance).
    *   **Best Practice:** Snapshots are not backups! Do not keep them for extended periods in production as they can impact performance and consume significant disk space.
*   **Edit Settings:** Modify CPU, memory, disk size (can often be expanded while VM is running, but OS needs to recognize it), network adapters, etc.
*   **Resource Allocation:** Adjust CPU, memory, and disk shares, reservations, and limits to prioritize critical VMs.
*   **Console:** Access the VM's graphical console for direct interaction.
*   **Migration (vMotion - with vCenter):** Move a running VM from one ESXi host to another without downtime.
*   **Cloning (with vCenter):** Create an exact copy of an existing VM.
*   **Templates (with vCenter):** Convert a VM into a template for rapid deployment of new, pre-configured VMs.

## Networking Configuration

ESXi uses **Virtual Switches (vSwitches)** to connect VMs to the physical network.

*   **Standard vSwitch:** Software-based switch configured on a single ESXi host.
    *   **Uplinks (Physical Adapters):** Connect the vSwitch to physical network interface cards (NICs) on the ESXi host.
    *   **Port Groups:** Logical groupings of ports on a vSwitch, defining network policies (VLANs, security, traffic shaping). VMs connect to port groups.
*   **Distributed vSwitch (vDS - with vCenter):** A centralized vSwitch that spans multiple ESXi hosts, simplifying network management and enabling advanced features like Network I/O Control and centralized firewalling.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **VLAN Tagging:** Assign VMs to specific VLANs by configuring the port group they connect to.
*   **NIC Teaming/Bonding:** Configure multiple physical NICs as uplinks to a vSwitch for redundancy and load balancing.
*   **Network Segmentation:** Use VLANs and separate port groups to isolate different types of traffic (e.g., VM traffic, vMotion, management, storage).

## Storage Configuration

ESXi uses **Datastores** to store VM files (VMDKs, VMX, logs, snapshots).

*   **Types of Datastores:**
    *   **VMFS (Virtual Machine File System):** VMware's proprietary clustered file system for block storage (Fibre Channel, iSCSI).
    *   **NFS (Network File System):** File-level storage over IP.
    *   **vSAN (Virtual SAN):** Software-defined storage that aggregates local disks from multiple ESXi hosts into a single shared datastore.
*   **Best Practices:**
    *   **Shared Storage:** For high availability features like vMotion, HA, and DRS, shared storage (SAN, NAS, vSAN) is essential.
    *   **Storage Performance:** Choose storage types and configurations that meet the performance requirements of your VMs (IOPS, throughput).
    *   **Storage I/O Control (SIOC - with vCenter):** Prioritize storage access for critical VMs.

## Security Best Practices

*   **Strong Passwords:** Use strong, complex passwords for ESXi root and vCenter accounts.
*   **Least Privilege:** Use role-based access control (RBAC) to grant users only the necessary permissions.
*   **Firewall:** Configure the ESXi host firewall to restrict access to management interfaces.
*   **Patching:** Regularly patch ESXi hosts and vCenter Server to address security vulnerabilities.
*   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate management networks from VM networks.
*   **VM Hardening:** Apply security best practices within the guest operating systems (e.g., disable unnecessary services, configure firewalls).
*   **Physical Security:** Secure physical access to your ESXi hosts in the data center.

## Monitoring and Management

*   **vCenter Server:** For large data centers, vCenter Server is indispensable for centralized management, monitoring, and automation of multiple ESXi hosts and VMs.
*   **Alarms and Alerts:** Configure alarms in vCenter (or directly on ESXi for basic alerts) to notify administrators of critical events (e.g., host disconnect, VM power off, high resource utilization).
*   **Performance Monitoring:** Use vCenter's performance charts to monitor CPU, memory, disk, and network usage of hosts and VMs.
*   **Logging:** Configure ESXi and vCenter to send logs to a centralized syslog server for analysis and auditing.
