## Introduction

This pipeline automates the process of:

*   **Infrastructure Provisioning:** Setting up the underlying Kubernetes cluster using Terraform.
*   **Application Building & Testing:** Using Jenkins to build application code, run tests, and containerize applications with Docker.
*   **Application Packaging & Deployment:** Leveraging Helm for Kubernetes-native application packaging and Jenkins for deploying to Kubernetes.

This end-to-end automation minimizes manual intervention, reduces errors, and accelerates the delivery of new features and updates.

## Key Components and Tools

*   **Terraform:**
    *   **Role:** Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool for provisioning and managing the Kubernetes cluster itself (e.g., EKS, GKE, AKS, or self-managed K8s on VMs).
    *   **Benefits:** Automates cluster setup, ensures consistency, enables version control of infrastructure.
*   **Jenkins:**
    *   **Role:** The central CI/CD orchestration server. It pulls code, triggers builds, runs tests, executes Docker commands, and manages Helm deployments.
    *   **Benefits:** Highly extensible, robust, and widely adopted for complex pipelines.
*   **Docker:**
    *   **Role:** Containerization platform. Applications are packaged into Docker images, ensuring consistency across environments.
    *   **Benefits:** Portability, isolation, efficient resource utilization.
*   **Helm:**
    *   **Role:** The package manager for Kubernetes. Applications are defined as Helm charts, which bundle all necessary Kubernetes resources (Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, etc.).
    *   **Benefits:** Simplifies Kubernetes application deployment, versioning, and management.
*   **Kubernetes:**
    *   **Role:** The container orchestration platform where the applications run. It manages the lifecycle of containers, scaling, networking, and storage.
    *   **Benefits:** Scalability, resilience, self-healing, efficient resource management.
*   **Container Registry:** (e.g., Docker Hub, ECR, GCR, Quay.io)
    *   **Role:** Stores the Docker images built by Jenkins.

## Step-by-Step CI/CD Workflow

1.  **Code Commit (Application Repository):**
    *   A developer pushes application code changes to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).

2.  **Jenkins CI Trigger:**
    *   Jenkins is configured to monitor the application repository. A webhook or polling mechanism triggers a new build upon code commit.

3.  **Jenkins Pipeline Execution:**

    *   **Stage 1: Infrastructure Provisioning (Terraform)**
        *   **Purpose:** Ensure the Kubernetes cluster is provisioned or updated to the desired state.
        *   **Tasks:**
            *   Jenkins checks out the Terraform code from a separate `infrastructure-repo`.
            *   `terraform init`: Initializes the Terraform working directory.
            *   `terraform plan`: Generates an execution plan (can be reviewed manually or automatically).
            *   `terraform apply -auto-approve`: Applies the changes to provision or update the Kubernetes cluster.
        *   **Output:** A ready-to-use Kubernetes cluster.

    *   **Stage 2: Application Build & Test (Docker)**
        *   **Purpose:** Build the application, run tests, and containerize it.
        *   **Tasks:**
            *   Jenkins checks out the application code from the `application-repo`.
            *   `npm install`, `mvn clean install`, etc.: Install application dependencies.
            *   `npm test`, `pytest`, `mvn test`: Run unit and integration tests.
            *   `docker build -t my-app:$(BUILD_NUMBER) .`: Build the Docker image of the application.
            *   `docker push my-app:$(BUILD_NUMBER)`: Push the Docker image to the Container Registry.
        *   **Output:** A tested Docker image available in the registry.

    *   **Stage 3: Application Deployment (Helm, Kubernetes)**
        *   **Purpose:** Deploy the new version of the application to the Kubernetes cluster.
        *   **Tasks:**
            *   Jenkins checks out the Helm chart for the application (can be in the `application-repo` or a separate `helm-charts-repo`).
            *   `helm upgrade --install my-app ./my-app-chart --namespace my-app-ns --set image.tag=$(BUILD_NUMBER)`:
                *   `upgrade --install`: Installs the chart if it doesn't exist, or upgrades it if it does.
                *   `my-app`: Release name for the Helm deployment.
                *   `./my-app-chart`: Path to the Helm chart.
                *   `--namespace my-app-ns`: Deploys to a specific Kubernetes namespace.
                *   `--set image.tag=$(BUILD_NUMBER)`: Overrides the image tag in the Helm chart's `values.yaml` to use the newly built Docker image.
            *   (Optional) Run post-deployment smoke tests or health checks on the deployed application.

5.  **Monitoring & Feedback:**
    *   Jenkins provides real-time feedback on pipeline status.
    *   Monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) track application and infrastructure performance in Kubernetes.
    *   Alerts notify teams of deployment failures or application issues.

## Best Practices for this Pipeline

*   **Separate Repositories:** Maintain separate Git repositories for application code, infrastructure code (Terraform), and Helm charts (if not co-located with application code).
*   **Idempotence:** Ensure all Terraform, Docker, and Helm operations are idempotent.
*   **Secrets Management:** Never hardcode secrets. Use Jenkins Credentials, environment variables, or dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets with Sealed Secrets) integrated with your pipeline.
*   **Environment Management:** Use different Terraform workspaces, Jenkins pipeline parameters, or Helm values files to manage deployments across different environments (dev, staging, production).
*   **Rollback Strategy:** Design clear rollback procedures. For Helm, `helm rollback` is powerful. For Terraform, `terraform destroy` or reverting to a previous state file.
*   **Testing at Each Stage:** Implement automated tests (unit, integration, end-to-end) at appropriate stages of the pipeline.
*   **Security Scanning:** Integrate security scans (SAST, SCA, container image scanning) into the Jenkins pipeline before deployment.
*   **Resource Management in Kubernetes:** Define `requests` and `limits` for CPU and memory in your Kubernetes deployments (via Helm charts) to ensure stable performance and efficient resource utilization.
*   **Observability:** Implement comprehensive logging, metrics, and tracing for your applications and infrastructure.
*   **Pipeline as Code:** Define your Jenkins pipeline using `Jenkinsfile` (Groovy script) stored in your Git repository for version control and collaboration.
